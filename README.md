# 📚 Research Paper Analysis & Clustering App

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that allows you to **upload research papers in PDF format**, automatically extract their text, and **analyze semantic similarity and clustering** of the documents using various machine learning techniques.

It’s especially useful for:

* Exploring large sets of academic papers
* Finding related works
* Visualizing thematic clusters
* Running similarity search between documents

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📄 **PDF Text Extraction** using `PyMuPDF`
* 🧠 **Semantic Embedding** using `sentence-transformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
* 🔍 **Paper Similarity Search** (via cosine similarity)
* 🧹 **Clustering Algorithms**:

  * DBSCAN
  * K-Means
  * Spectral Clustering
  * Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
  * Agglomerative Clustering
  * OPTICS
* 🕸️ **Graph-Based Visualizations** with NetworkX and Matplotlib
* 🌐 **Interactive UI** via Streamlit

## 📝 Example Output

```
Top 5 Similar Papers to "paper1.pdf":
1. paper2.pdf (0.79 similarity)
2. paper3.pdf (0.75)
...

Clusters:
- Cluster 0: [paper1.pdf, paper3.pdf]
- Cluster 1: [paper2.pdf, paper4.pdf]
...
```

## 🐞 Known Issues

* KMeans on Windows with MKL might cause memory leak warnings. You can suppress this by setting:

  ```bash
  set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
  ```
